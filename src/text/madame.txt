The famous clairvoyante, last in a long line of European royalty. She lives alone on a wind-swept island, sketching the visions that the sea breeze brings her. Her tarot is infused with a fey wisdom; drawn in pale colours that resemble the light reflecting off shallow water and the strange salt-blanched objects that wash up daily on her shores.
