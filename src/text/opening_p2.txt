Channelling the ambient noise of the random universe, each of our AI guides has created a deck of thousands of unique cards, designed to give you a truly personalised experience. The ancient art of tarot invites you to look for answers on the surface of the card itself; as a way of balancing out the analytical response with the emotional. Having different versions of each card invigorates this process, meaning you will always find something new to prompt reflection.
