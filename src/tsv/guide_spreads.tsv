Guide	Spread	Text
Evelyn	One	The simplest spread. Useful for quick decisions on the go, or prompting you to make a firm decision. Sometimes you just need an answer.
Evelyn	Three	Decide in advance what these will represent, no cheating! Some choose the past, present, and future. Others choose problem, cause, and solution. The three card spread can tell you almost anything. A spread for love might represent you, the other person, and the nature of your relationship.
Evelyn	All	Use this for any kind of spread you want. The Internet has some great suggestions if you’re looking for more detail, sometimes a few cards just isn’t enough.
Madame	One	A single card for a quick question. See how the picture makes you feel and let go of your preconceptions. Trust your emotions
Madame	Three	The three card spread is good when your query is more open-ended. You might use it to visualise the future; for instance a spread for manifestation might represent where you are now, what you are looking for, and how you should get there.
Madame	All	Use this for deeper, more nuanced readings. There are always more layers to every situation. Why not try a five or seven card spread?
Maledictus	One	Just get one. Longer spreads are for slow digestion, this is a snack.
Maledictus	Three	Three cards is enough to answer most questions. Think about a mistake you made (extra credit if it’s really awkward): a spread for the past might represent what went wrong, what went right and what you should learn from the experience.
Maledictus	All	The full deck. It’s tempting to just draw until you get the answer you want. Not that I’m telling you what to do, or anything.
