Three	Three Cards	Decide in advance what these will represent, no cheating! Some choose the past, present, and future. Others choose problem, cause, and solution. The three card spread can tell you almost anything. A spread for love might represent you, the other person, and the nature of your relationship.	The three card spread is good when your query is more open-ended. You might use it to visualise the future; for instance a spread for manifestation might represent where you are now, what you are looking for, and how you should get there.	Three cards is enough to answer most questions. Think about a mistake you made (extra credit if it’s really awkward): a spread for the past might represent what went wrong, what went right and what you should learn from the experience.	;
