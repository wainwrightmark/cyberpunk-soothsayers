Madame Sosoteris sees The World as a map, think on where you’ve travelled and what you’ve learned.
Maledictus	World	The world represents achievement, accomplishment and travel; the promise of discovery and the satisfaction of completion.	You should take a moment to be proud of your success, remember to take stock of things that make you happy and finish any passion projects.	This card usually represents a milestone in your life, often one coming as a result of hard work. It’s a reminder to celebrate and reflect.	It could stand for someone special in your life, often a lover, ally or friend who will be at your side forever.	Maledictus believes you are close to finishing something significant, you just need to will yourself over the line.
