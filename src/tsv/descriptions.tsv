You should take a moment to be proud of your success, remember to take stock of things that make you happy and finish any passion projects.	This card usually represents a milestone in your life, often one coming as a result of hard work. It's a reminder to celebrate and reflect.	It could stand for someone special in your life, often a lover, ally or friend who you want at your side forever.	Maledictus says The World won't last forever - enjoy it while you can.
